# Data_Analysis_Modeling_and_Implementation_via_Web_Application_(SNPedia_Web_Application)

This project is a comprehensive endeavor focusing on data analysis, modeling, and implementation using the SNPedia dataset. Developed as part of the BSc Computer Science program at the University of London, the web application serves as a platform to explore genetic information through a user-friendly interface.

## Project Overview

The application revolves around three main pillars:
1. **Data Analysis and Modeling**: Utilizing the SNPedia dataset, the project sets out to understand complex genetic data and its interrelations to offer meaningful insights.
2. **Web Application Development**: A user-friendly platform with features like dark mode and an integrated web scraper for real-time data retrieval.
3. **Genetic Research Support**: By structuring SNP information effectively, the application aids researchers in exploring the genetic connections between SNPs, traits, and diseases.

## Features

- **Entity-Relationship (E/R) Modeling**: Captures relationships between SNPs, genotypes, and literature references.
- **Dark Mode Interface**: Enhances user experience while interacting with genetic data.
- **Web Scraper Integration**: Efficient data gathering from SNPedia, with robust handling of various web structures.

## Dataset Details

- **Source**: [SNPedia](https://www.snpedia.com/)
- **License**: Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License.
- **Characteristics**: Real-world, complex, and community-driven data containing over 100,000 SNP entries, suitable for genetic research and analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Web browser
- Internet connection
- Local server environment for running the application

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    bash git clone https://github.com/username/snpedia-web-app.git

2. Set up the local server environment.
3. Import the project into your local server's root directory.
4. Run the server and access the application via your web browser.

## Technical Details

- **Web Scraper**: Handles network requests and data parsing while considering performance implications.
- **Database**: Structured using SQL, enabling efficient data retrieval and management.

## Challenges and Considerations

- Tackling data variability and ensuring standardization.
- Optimizing scraper performance for large datasets and frequent data updates.
